This Website was intentionally created from scratch to demonstrate how learning along side project development can help improve skill retention.

The site will be developed fully using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript. I intend to incorporate an AI chatbot that visitors to the site can chat with regards service offered.

First, I created a website file structure that will help guide where files will be placed and even help guide what I need to create.

To make the coding experince more enjoyable I had customized my VS Code with various extension that helped with theme of the application, code styling, material design icons and even a coding assistant AI.
