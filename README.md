# Building the Electronic Exchange Website: A Journey of Learning and Innovation

Welcome to the development diary of the Electronic Exchange website! This project is a testament to how learning alongside project development can significantly enhance skill retention and foster innovation.

## Project Overview

This website is being meticulously crafted from scratch using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. The goal is to create a fully functional site that not only showcases the business services but also incorporates an AI chatbot to engage visitors and provide information about service offerings.

## The Journey Begins

### Day 1: Setting up the Development Environment & Layout of file structure.

To make the coding experience more enjoyable and efficient, I customized my VS Code with various extensions. These include:

- **Theme Extensions**: To enhance the visual appeal of the editor.
- **Code Styling Extensions**: To maintain consistent code formatting.
- **Material Design Icons**: For a modern and clean look.
- **AI Coding Assistant**: To provide suggestions and improve productivity.

I then set up the initial file structure for the website. This foundational step is crucial as it helps organize the project and guides the development process. Here's a glimpse of the structure:

- `index.html`
- `assets/`
  - `css/`
  - `images/`
  - `js/`

### Day 2: Designing the Homepage Layout

Started working on the layout using HTML and CSS. The focus was on creating a responsive design that looks great on all devices. Bootstrap was a great help in achieving this.

By adding the Bootstrap CDN code I was able to add the carousel to display messages in rotation and then added a navbar, footer and a card design also from bootstrap. I was able to customize some of the bootstrap elements with the codes in my style.css and header.css files

### Day 4: Adding Interactivity

Incorporated JavaScript to add interactivity to the site. This includes dynamic content updates and user interactions.

## What's Next?

Stay tuned as I continue to document each step of this exciting journey. Future updates will include:

- Adding other pages.
- Adding chatbot's capabilities.
- Adding more interactive elements.
- Optimizing the site for performance and SEO.
